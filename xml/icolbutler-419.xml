                        <p> While the hand is largely consistent (the letters are generally spaced evenly and of a similar dimension), there is some variation in lettering, which is especially visible in the rendering of the letter M. Variety is also visible in the appearance of the interpuncts (slashes and points are both present) and they do not have a consistent depth, though this may be the product of wear on the surface. The hederae (discussed below) are likewise not consistent. However, there is no clear evidence for suggesting that this epitaph is the product of multiple hands.</p>

While they are roughly the same size (3.3cm vs. 3.5cm measured on the diagonal), the first hedera is topped with a hook curving to the left, while the second remains straight. There are also small traces of paint visible.</p>
