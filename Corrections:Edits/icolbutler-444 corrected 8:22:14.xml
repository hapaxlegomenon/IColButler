The top left-hand corner has been broken off, a rectangle approximately ca. 6.0 by 7.5 cm., but the general size of the tablet can be projected. Small parts of the edges have been folded over the front surface. Six small holes puncture the object without loss to the text. The varying thickness of the tablet and contours of the back surface give the impression that holes have been patched at a later period with poured lead. Many letters are so worn they are difficult to read.</p>

<!-- From "Inscriptions as Evidence," (p. 129) "Figure 22: Giovanni Battista Fontei, De prisca Caesiorum gente cornmentariorum libri duo 
cum Iulii Iacobonii appendice (Bologna 1583) 174. This shows a forged inscription from the 
Cesi collection at Rome (CIL VI.3440*), mentioning a ‘Caesius Aequidicus’ (possibly 
‘speaker of justice’) who lived for 100 years. Fontei and Giacoboni note that they have not 
seen the word ‘Aequidicus’ elsewhere (one reason that subsequent scholars have believed the 
inscription to be a forgery) but they do not explicitly doubt its veracity. "  -->

<!-- I'm interested in looking into more of the speaking inscriptions/forgeries thereof; will be doing some research and can add some commentary to this -->
